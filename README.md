# why is the repo for:
answer: this repo records the practices and notes I had when reading the book the c programming (K&R)
# does this repo contains all the questions ?
answer: No. only part of the questions are included. Chapter 8 is skipped due to the overlap with the book: advanced linux programming. 
# Should I read your repo:
answer: You are welcome to. I know that the answers I have solved the problems, but they are definitely NOT PERFECT, since this is my first time
doing C related stuff. A better source is here http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions
